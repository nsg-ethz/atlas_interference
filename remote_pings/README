- The client and the collector that you can find on these subdirectories have been
designed to execute ping measurements from several machines and push results, in
real-time, to the server. Results are stored in the collector machine and users
can use them while pings measurement are still running on the clients.
- This tool has also been designed to perform pings with several flow-IDs. As RTTs
may vary depending on the path used, pings different flow-ID independatly is
recommended for a good precision. 
- This tool is based atop Scamper.

If you want to try this tool :

1) Create a file where are indicated clients IP address as well as the IP
addresses they must ping.
For example :

------------my_file.txt---------------
xx.xx.xx.xx	yy.yy.yy.yy
xx.xx.xx.xx	zz.zz.zz.zz
aa.aa.aa.aa	bb.bb.bb.bb
aa.aa.aa.aa	yy.yy.yy.yy
--------------end file----------------

Description :

xx.xx.xx.xx will ping yy.yy.yy.yy and zz.zz.zz.zz
aa.aa.aa.aa will ping bb.bb.bb.bb and yy.yy.yy.yy

2) create a directory where the collector will store the results

mkdir my_data

3) Compile the client

You may want to use the makefile

4)

Start the collector :
python collector.py -p 6700 -i my_file.txt -d my_dir

The collector will listen on port 6700. Results will be stored in the
directory my_dir. The collector will send to each client the list of 
destinations to ping thanks to my_file.txt.

Start each client :
./client -s ff.ff.ff.ff -p 6700 -f 16 -n 10 -w 1

where ff.ff.ff.ff is the IP address of the server, 16 is the number of flow-ID,
1 is the number of ping per frequency and per flow-ID and per second, 10 is the
number of ping to execute before pushing results to the server.
