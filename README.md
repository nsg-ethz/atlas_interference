# Quantifying interference between measurements on the RIPE Atlas platform

You can find on this git repositery all the scripts and tools that we used to
generate traffic from and towards Atlas probes and measure the interference
effects (see http://thomasholterbach.net/Thomas_Holterbach_IMC15.pdf).

In the remote_pings directory is stored the tool that we built to generate
traffic from NL Ring nodes and towards Atlas probes.

In the atlas_scripts directory are stored all the scripts we used to start
pings and one-off traceroutes on Atlas probes.

Using these tools and scripts, it is possible to load an Atlas probe and see
the interference effects.
